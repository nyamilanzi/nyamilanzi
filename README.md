I'm a statistical epidemiologist & data scientist focused on maternal/child health and social-impact analytics. I believe in using data science to create meaningful change in healthcare and beyond.

* 🏢 I lead **Femanalytica** (<https://github.com/Femanalytica>) where we build data science tools for the social sector
* 🎯 Focus areas: AI/ML for maternal & neonatal health, bias auditing and equity in health AI, gender analytics, data literacy programs especially for women
* 🤝 Community & service: Royal Statistical Society, Women in Data Science Ambassador
* 🎤 Speaking & training: RSS Future Leaders Fellow; Women in Data Science; community programs via Femanalytica Skills Hub
* 🌍 Locations: United Kingdom & Malawi

## What I'm working on now 🚀

Currently developing **FEMSTAT**, a comprehensive gender-stratified statistical analysis platform that enables researchers and organizations to conduct rigorous gender analysis with bias assessment, professional reporting, and gender-transformative insights. This SaaS platform combines advanced statistical methods with gender analysis expertise to provide actionable insights for policy and programmatic decision-making.
Also working on **MamaMind** a postnatal depression screening AI enhanced tool aimed at Malawian mothers to raise awareness of depression and anxiety post giving birth and offering resources to seek help and support. 

## What I'm thinking about 💭

Exploring the intersection of AI ethics and maternal health outcomes, particularly how algorithmic bias affects healthcare decision-making in low-resource settings. Also pondering new approaches to data visualization that make complex health statistics more accessible to diverse audiences.
