## What I'm working on now 🚀
Currently developing a virtual menu system for healthcare facilities to improve patient experience and streamline operations. This project combines user experience design with data analytics to create intuitive, accessible interfaces.

## What I'm thinking about 💭
Exploring the intersection of AI ethics and maternal health outcomes, particularly how algorithmic bias affects healthcare decision-making in low-resource settings. Also pondering new approaches to data visualization that make complex health statistics more accessible to diverse audiences.
